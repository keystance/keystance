# keystance
 ## An open source text editor. Mostly inspired by the kilo text editor and vim.


 ### How to contribute
  You can open a pull request or an issue if you've found a bug or if you have an idea for a new feature.

 ### How to read the codebase
  Inside the include folder there is the keystance.h file. This is where all of the defines and includes are located
  In the src folder there is the main.c file where all the code for the actual text editor is located
  In the analyzer folder is the source code for the syntax error analyzer.
  In the errors folder are all the errors the analyzer can throw at you.

 ### What I want to implement
  * Syntax error checking in C.
  * More keyboard shortcuts.

 ### What I'm currently workin on
  * Syntax error checking in C

 ### What is keystance built with ?
  * NeoVim
  * Vim
  * Atom
  * VsCode
  * C
  * gcc

 ### Why should you use keystance ?
  I'm going to be real here. There isn't any reason to use keystance at all because there are already a lot of text editors out there.
